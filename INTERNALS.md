This file contains information about the internal organization of this piece of software.

To develop, do the following:
1)Install php, with the command line executable.
2)Install composer.
3)composer install

This will install the document-compiling-cms composer package from github (https://github.com/raymond1/document-compiling-cms).

This tool is able to cobble pieces of files together. It's not the worst, but it is horrible. In any case, I made it, so I'm going to use it. 

To use this tool, do the following:

php vendor/raymond1/document-compiling-cms/generate_website.php src/script.txt

This will trigger the "compilation" process.
