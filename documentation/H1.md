# H1 File Format

## Purpose

The H1 file format is an alternative to the M1 format used to specify a parser in the form of a tree structure. It is meant to be a human-readable format that is also simple enough for parsers to be written for it without too much effort.

# Syntax

Parsers are stored in memory as a type of node tree. Each node has a specific depth and a node type. The H1 file format considers the root node of the parser to be at depth 0.

The H1 file format is line-based. Each line is either: a)a node type preceded by 0 or more spaces, or b)a string preceded by zero or more spaces. The "depth" of a line is the number of spaces before the beginning of the node name or string. Both strings and node types are known as nodes for the purpose of this file format specification.

If a node is at depth n in memory, then it will have n spaces before it in an H1 file to indicate its depth inside the file. Line 1 contains the node at depth 0.

Let n by any node. The children of n will be located different lines, but will always come before any sibling of n. This means basically that for any node, its descendents will be located on a line before any siblings.

Carriage returns inside of strings are escaped using the text ENC(N).
