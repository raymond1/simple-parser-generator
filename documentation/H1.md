# H1 File Format

## Introduction

The H1 file format is a small language used for describing V1 virtual machines using Space Tree notation. It is an alternative to the M1 format used for the same purpose, but was meant to be more human-readable.

This file provides a tutorial for using the H1 file format.

## Tutorial

### A simple example
Let's begin with a simple example for an H1 file:

character class
 bcd

This file describes a parser that uses a character class function to detect the characters 'b','c', and 'd'. The first line is the name of the function(also called a node in the context of the Simple Parser Generator). The second line is a configuration parameter. When an input string is passed in, the character class function will compare its run-time input letter by letter with the list of characters in the configuration parameter. As each letter of the input is compared, if the letter is one of the configuration parameters, then the next letter is compared. As soon as all the letters have been used up, or, there is a mismatch, a data object is returned. This data object will contain key-value pairs:

matchString:aaacccxxx
matchFound:false
parent:(null)
depth:0
inputString:aaacccxxx
type:entire
id:8
serial:7


### A more complicated example

 letter is one of t with the c

A character class node is known as a micro-parser, that is, it can be thought of as a very simple, predefined parser--you can think of it as a function--that takes in a string as input and returns a piece of data after analyzing the input string. In this case, a character class node will behave as follows: is configured with the string "bcd", which me

An H1 file contains a series of root nodes
