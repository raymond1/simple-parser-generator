# H1 File Format

## Purpose

The H1 file format is a simple format used to specify a parser in a human-readable format that is also simple enough for parsers to be written for it. It is useful for describing a tree of information n.

# Syntax

The H1 file format is meant to describe a tree of nodes, where each node has a type. Each different type of node is used to specify the functionality of a part of the parser that the entire tree represents. Nodes may or may not have associated properties or connections to other node types.

The types of nodes are:

* Sequence
* Or
* And
* Multiple
* Not
* Optional
* Character Class
* String Literal
* Rule Name
* Rule
* Rule List

The node types can be thought of as representing tiny atomic computers that take in a string an apply small operations on them. Each node individually can parse very simple parts of a string. When put together like Lego, these 11 node types are sufficient for specifying certain simple types of parsers.
