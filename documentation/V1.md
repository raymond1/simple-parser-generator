# V1 Virtual Machines

A V1 virtual machine is any parser loaded into memory consisting of V1 micro-parser nodes. V1 virtual machine micro-parser nodes are conceptual minimalistic parsers that can be configured together to create a more complex parser.

Conceptually, V1 virtual machines are assembled into memory into a tree structure, much like a grammar tree, and work by taking in an input string. The different nodes of a V1 virtual machine help to process the input string in different ways to generate output data in the form of "match objects".

Each node in the V1 virtual machine tree can be thought of as a function that takes in a string input, and possibly some other related metadata, and produces an output object. Different nodes in the virtual machine tree represent different functions, but each node individually is meant to be have a simple implementation and operational purpose. Micro-parser nodes(sometimes just called nodes) may have internal state.

The list of nodes that make up a V1 virtual machine are described below.

## Character Class
### General concept
Character class nodes are meant to describe a set of characters that a test string can be compared with. The result of such a comparison can be thought of as a true or false value, with true indicating that a letter is one of the letters associated with the character class and false indicating that a letter is not.

Unlike regular expression character classes, character class nodes by default match against multiple letters of an input string as long as the letters belong to the list of characters listed in the character class internal string.

### Properties
string: The internal string value holding the letters for which an input string will be tested against for determination of whether the input string letters belong to the character class or not.

Character class nodes have no children.

### Match object properties
matchLength will be equal to the number of consecutive letters starting from the head of the input that are found in the internal string value.

matchFound will be true if matchLength is greater than 0 and will be false otherwise.

matchString will consist of the first matchLength letters of the input string.

### Example
s = '01234', i = '4445'. o = '444'

If the character class's internal string, s, is equal to '01234' and the input string is '4445', then the matchString property will be '444', matchLength will be 3 and matchFound will be true. This is because the first 3 letters of the input string '4445' are found in the internal string '01234', whereas 5 is not.



## String Literal
### General concept
String literal nodes are meant to detect fixed strings. If an input string starts with the string literal, then this node will match.

### Properties
string: The internal string value that the input string must start with for a match.

Character class nodes have no children.

### Match object properties
matchLength will be equal to the length of the internal string if the input string starts with the internal string. Otherwise, matchLength will be 0.

matchFound will be true if matchLength is greater than 0.

matchString will be equal to the internal string if matchFound is true. Otherwise, matchString will be the empty string.



## Or
### Description
The general idea behind the 'or' node is that matching operations must be run on its children in order to determine the output object property values for the 'or' node itself. If any of the child nodes produce a match object with the matchFound property equal to true when fed with the input string i, then the 'or' node itself matches. The first child node in the array of child nodes belonging to the 'or' node that produces a match object with a matchFound property equal to true when fed with the input string i is called the 'first matching child'. It is assumed that an or node will have two or more children.

### Properties
nodes: an array of child nodes

### Match object properties
matchFound will be set to true if any of the child nodes produce a match object with the matchFound property equal to true when fed with the input string. Otherwise, matchFound will be false.

matchLength will be equal to the matchLength property of the first matching child if matchFound is true. Otherwise, matchLength will be 0.

matchString will be equal to the matchString value of the first matching child if matchFound is true. Otherwise, it will be ''.

matches will be equal to the an array where each element of the array is a match object from a child node. It will have the same number of elements as the number of child nodes.



## Sequence
### Description
The 'sequence' node has one or more children. The idea is that all of its children nodes must match in order for the 'sequence' node to match. The first part of the input string must match with the first child node. Any subsequent child node will then need to match with the remaining unmatched string after matching with the previous node is complete.

For example:

If a sequence node has 3 child nodes, and the three child nodes are all string literal nodes, where the first string literal node matches with 'ab', the second with 'cd', the third with 'ef', then the sequence node will successfully match if the input string is 'abcdef'. 

During the process of matching, the following steps would occur:
1)The input string, being 'abcdef' is fed into the sequence node.
2)The first child of the sequence node, being the 'string literal' node matching 'ab', is tested against the string 'abcdef'. A successful match of length 2, with match string 'ab' is found.
3)The second child of the sequence node will be tested against the remaining unmatched string from step 2. The remaining unmatched string is 'cdef'. Therefore, the second child is fed the input string 'cdef'.
4)The third child of the sequence node will be tested against the remaining unmatched string from step 3, which is 'ef'. Since it is a match, the third child node returns a successful match.
5)The sequence node's children all match, so the sequence node itself is a successful match, with length equal to the sum of the lengths of the match objects generated by its child nodes.

### Properties
nodes: an array of child nodes

### Match object properties
matchFound: true if the match object of all child nodes has a matchFound property equal to true. False otherwise.

matchLength: If matchFound is true, matchlength is equal to the sum of the matchLength properties returned from the child node match objects. If matchFound is false, matchLength is 0.

matchString: Equal to the first matchLength letters of the input string.

matches: An array with the same number of elements as the number of child nodes. The first child node's match object is placed into the first element of the array. The second child node's match object is placed into the second element, and so on.

## And
### Description
The 'and' node has two or more children. The input string is applied to each child and if every child matches with the input string then the 'and' node itself matches.

### Properties
nodes: an array of child micro-parser nodes.

### Match object properties
matchFound: true if the match object of all child nodes has a matchFound property equal to true. False otherwise.

matchLength: If matchFound is true, matchlength is equal to the minimum match length out of all the child node match length objects objects.

matchString: Equal to the first matchLength letters of the input string.

matches: An array with the same number of elements as the number of child nodes. The first child node's match object is placed into the first element of the array. The second child node's match object is placed into the second element, and so on.

## Multiple
The 'multiple' node has one child. The idea behind it is to be able to detect strings starting with one or more consecutive matches of any child node. For example: a multiple node with a child node that is a string literal node containing the internal string 'ab' would match when fed with the input string 'ababab', 'ab', or 'abc' because all these three input strings start with one or more consecutive matches of 'ab'.

The detailed algorithm by which the multiple node deals with matching is as follows:

Let i be equal to the input string. Let c be 0. (c represents the caret position.)
Step A)The multiple node is initially associated with a child node.
Step B)The child node is tested against the input string i. If there was a match, then continue from step C1. If there was no match, then continue from step C2.
Step C1) The match output object from the child node from step B will have a matchLength property greater than zero. Increment c by the matchLength. Let i_prime be equal to i, except truncated at the left by matchLength. Call i_prime i and continue the algorithm from step B.
Step C2)If c is greater than 0, the multiple node produces a match object with matchLength equal to c. This is the end of the algorithm.

### Properties
nodes: An array containing a single element, which is a micro-parser node.

### Match object properties
matchFound: True if the algorithm in the description produces a match output object with matchLength property greater than 0. False otherwise.

matchLength: Equal to the final value of c in the algorithm in the description.

matchString: Equal to the final value of c in the algorithm in the description.

matches: An array with the same number of elements as the number of times step B was applied in the algorithm in the description. Each element will be the match object produced during the comparison step in step B.

## Not
The 'not' node has one child. The input string is matched against the child node. If the child node does not match then the 'not' node matches.

### Properties
nodes: An array containing a single micro-parser node.

### Match object properties
matchFound: True if the child node fails to match. False otherwise.

matchLength: Equal to 0 if the child node matches. Equal to the match length of the child node match object if the child node did not match.

matchString: Equal to the final value of c in the algorithm in the description.

matches: An array with the same number of elements as the number of times step B was applied in the algorithm in the description. Each element will be the match object produced during the comparison step in step B.

## Optional
The 'optional' has one child node and it always matches successfully, but may produce a match object with a match length, affecting further parsing. The match length of the output object determined by the length of the child node match, being equal to it.

### Properties
nodes: An array containing a single micro-parser node.

### Match object properties
matchFound: Always equal to true.

matchLength: Equal to if the child node does not match. Equal to the match length of the child node match object otherwise.

matchString: Equal to the first matchLength characters of the input string.

matches: An array with one element containing the match object from the child node.

## Entire
The 'entire' node has one child node. It matches successfully if the input string length is equal to the match length of the child node.

### Properties
nodes: An array containing a single micro-parser node.

### Match object properties
matchFound: Equal to true if the match length of the child match object when fed with the input string is the same length as the input string.

matchLength: Equal to 0 if matchFound is false. Equal to the length of the input string otherwise.

matchString: Equal to the input string if matchFound is true. Equal to '' otherwise.

matches: An array with one element containing the match object from the child node.
